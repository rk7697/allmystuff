#I also didn't include this, but there was another cool(and much slower) version of this where I recursively opened files on desktop that ran this so that 
#the pygame window would briefly open and close again. This defintely wasn't super efficient, but it was kind of funny. I apologize my video was also kind
#of laggy.
